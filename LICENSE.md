[JavaCC 21](https://javacc.com/) is a continuation of work on the well known JavaCC parser generator released by Sun Microsystems in mid 2003, under a BSD-style open source license. The source code of JavaCC 21 is available under pretty much identical terms. 

In the interests of absolute clarity, it behooves us to add that these license terms refer to the *source code of the tool itself*. Any code that users *generate* using the tool belongs to them alone and is completely unencumbered. Since that is the important part for most users, it bears repeating:

**ANY CODE THAT USERS GENERATE USING THE TOOL BELONGS TO THEM ALONE AND IS COMPETELY UNENCUMBERED.**
