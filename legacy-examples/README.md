## Legacy JavaCC Examples

This directory contains example code from prehistoric times. These things were
in the legacy JavaCC distro already in 2008. I may have made some minor adjustments
to keep them working and I run over them all as part of the testcases in test.xml

The examples in the examples/ directory are ones I added and are
designed to illustrate the usage of the more up-to-date version of the tool, i.e.
[JavaCC 21](http://javacc.com)
